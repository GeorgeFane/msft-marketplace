# 1155 Marketplace

This project contains an Ethereuem smart contract backend that inherits from ERC-1155 (the one that handles both fungible and non-fungible tokens) and a React frontend that is a video game item marketplace. This is a Blockchain at Michigan consulting project with Microsoft, and is hosted at https://georgefane.github.io/msft-marketplace/
